# DevBuddy

DevBuddy is a platform designed for junior software engineers seeking to connect with fellow developers to find an accountability buddy. Our motto is: ‘We don’t make it easier to become a software developer, but you don’t have to be alone while becoming one.’

This platform is the final project of Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp batch #1576.
